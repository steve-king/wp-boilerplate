WP-Boilerplate

I got fed up of searching for decent HTML5 Boilerplate-based Wordpress starter themes, 
so here is my own. This is heavily based on Paul Irish's HTML5 Boilerplate, also some 
inspiration came from Zencoder's wordpress boilerplate.

Aims:

To be as minimal as possible - When I start a new site I don't like having to delete 
loads of templates I don't need. index.php and single.php ought to be enough to get you 
started. No tags, no author links, no category links etc clogging up the markup - every 
website is different - if you need them, why don't you add them yourself?

To integrate as much of the useful stuff in HTML5 Boilerplate as reasonably possible

No unit tests or stuff like that. I never use them. When I learn to, maybe I'll include it.
