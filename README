WP-Boilerplate

I got fed up of searching for decent HTML5 Boilerplate-based Wordpress starter themes, 
so here is my own. This is heavily based on Paul Irish's HTML5 Boilerplate, also some 
inspiration came from Zencoder's wordpress boilerplate.

Aims:

To be as minimal as possible - When I start a new site I don't like having to delete 
loads of templates I don't need. index.php ought to be enough to get 
started

To integrate as much of the useful stuff in HTML5 Boilerplate as reasonably possible.

No unit tests or build scripts. I've never used them. When I learn to, maybe I'll include them.
No html/css comments - this is based on the 'stripped' HTML5Boilerplate

Look in the html5-boilerplate folder for stuff you may want to move to the server root. Here's some notes about them courtesy of zencoder:

Root Files
----------
These files can be found in the html5-boilerplate folder in the theme. Some of the files listed here should be (carefully) moved to the root of your site (same level as the wp-content directory). Read on for specific instructions.

### 404 Page
If you use permanlinks (WP-Admin > Settings > Permalinks), then WordPress handles any 404s with the 404.php included in the theme. If you don't use permalinks, then add the 404.html file to the root of your site.

### .htaccess
**Do not copy to the root of your site.** This may overwrite the WordPress htaccess, and break Wordpress. Instead, copy and paste the contents of this file to the .htaccess already at the root of your site, after the existing content. It would be good to make a comment where the Boilerplate content begins, like "# Begin HTML5 Boilerplate". Read htaccess file for more info on what it does.
**This file may not be visible if you're viewing the folder on your computer. Files that start with a "." are often hidden. It should be visible through your FTP browser once uploaded.**

### crossdomain.xml
If you don't know what this is, you probably don't need it.

### robots.txt
Tells all search engines that they can read and index all pages. This is handled by WordPress so you shouldn't need to move this to the root.

Root Images
-----------
These are included with the HTML5 Boilerplate. I've removed references to them in header.php - if you place them in the root
directory of your server they will work.

### favicon.ico
The favicon is the icon shown to the left of the URL at the top of your browser window.

### apple-touch-icon.png
On iPhones and iPads you can book mark a web page and have it show up on the home screen as an icon. The apple-touch-icon.png becomes this icon if used. Rounded corners and glossy finish are added by the device.
